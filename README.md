## Mars News
This repository contains code and data for analyzing the district-wide standardized test results of a school district. The goal of this analysis is to identify trends and patterns in school performance based on math and reading scores, as well as other information about the schools.

Background
This is a full web-scraping and data analysis project where you can work with HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. You can scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.
